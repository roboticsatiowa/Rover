## About <a name = "about"></a>

Our rover uses 6 wheeled rocker bogie suspension system along with a 5 DOF custom arm. The onboard computing is handled by an Nvidia Jetson Xavier coupled with a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller to assist with IO. The rover is equipped with an Intel Realsense depth camera, 3 Cameras, and GPS.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Ubuntu LTS 22.04

### Installing

Clone the repository and run the install script.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roboticsatiowa/Rover.git
chmod u+x ./Rover/install.sh
./Rover/install.sh
```
### Running the code

There are several launch files for various subsystems. To run the entire system, use the following command.
```bash
ros2 launch rover_launch launch_all.launch.py
```
[ROS Isaac Installation](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/getting_started/isaac_ros_buildfarm_cdn.html)

`docker run -it ros2-humble-isaac`

The system can also be run remotely using ssh. This is done via the ```remote_launch.sh``` 
This script should not need to be run directly.
